     * SharpLink v1.0.1
     *
     * This namespace contains classes that allow low privileged user accounts to create
     * file system and registry symbolic links.
     *
     * File system symbolic links created by functions from this namespace are pseudo-links
     * that consist out of the combination of a Junction with an object manager symbolic link
     * in the '\RPC Control' object directory. This technique was publicized by James Forshaw
     * and implemented within his symboliclink-testing-tools:
     *
     *      - https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools
     *
     * We used James's implementation as a reference for the classes implemented in this namespace.
     * Moreover, the C# code for creating the junctions was mostly copied from these resources:
     *
     *      - https://gist.github.com/LGM-AdrianHum/260bc9ab3c4cd49bc8617a2abe84ca74
     *      - https://coderedirect.com/questions/136750/check-if-a-file-is-real-or-a-symbolic-link
     *
     * Also the implementation of registry symbolic links is very close to the one within the
     * symboliclink-testing-tools and credits go to James again. Furthermore, the following
     * resource was used as a reference:
     *
